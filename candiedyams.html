                    <h3>What is a Candied Yam?</h3>
                    <p> <b>Candied Yam</b> is a southern classic dish that is actually made using <em>sweet potato</em>. The sweet potato is cut into pieces and covered with butter and two different types of sugar. Once heated the mixture combines to create
                        a sweet and buttery syrup which carmelizes the sweet potato pieces to make candied yams. Do yams and sweet potatoes taste the same? No, they do not. Real yams are native to Africa and are a root vegetable that looks similar to
                        the bark of a tree. It has a more starchy flavor, similar to a regular potato. Yams can be purchased in speciality markets. Sweet potatoes are more commonly found in grocery stores. They are sweet and have a reddish-brown outer
                        skin with an orange sweet flesh in the center. It is not uncommon for sweet potatoes to be labeled as yams in supermarkets.</p>

                    <h3>How to Make the Best Candied Yams:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Place the cut yams into a pot and cover with water.</li>
                        <li>Bring the yams to a low rolling boil and cook until they have a bite and can be pierced with a fork.</li>
                        <li>Next, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. and grab a square baking dish.</li>
                        <li>Drain the water off the yams and carefully pour evenly into the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the top of the cooked yams evenly with cinnamon and nutmeg.</li>
                        <li>Spread the granulated sugar and brown sugar over the yams to evenly distribute.</li>
                        <li>Top with the cubes of butter evenly over the top.</li>
                        <li>Place the yams into the oven to bake 10 minutes. The butter should be melted and the candied mixture at the bottom of the baking dish. Remove the baking dish from the oven and gently toss the candied yams to evenly cover in the
                            mixture.
                        </li>
                        <li>Place back into the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes, until the yams are fork-tender. Serve while still warm as a side dish to compliment any meal.</li>
